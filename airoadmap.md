## Dataset:

Data Source: Historical blockchain transaction data, including smart contract executions, transaction timestamps, and energy consumption details, will be collected from various blockchain platforms. These data sources should provide a representative and diverse dataset for training.

## Machine Learning:

1. Machine Learning Algorithms: GreenContractsAI will utilize a combination of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques, to model energy consumption in smart contract blockchains.

2. Deep Learning: Deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can capture complex patterns in the data. Recurrent networks are especially useful for sequential data like blockchain transactions.

## Process Flow

1. User Registration and Onboarding
2. GreenContractsAI offers options for integrating with various blockchain platforms and data sources. The user selects the blockchain platform they are working with and connects their data source.
3. The AI platform performs an initial analysis of the user's historical blockchain data to understand the specific patterns and characteristics unique to their environment. Based on the historical data, GreenContractsAI trains machine learning models, including deep neural networks, to understand energy consumption patterns on the user's blockchain platform.
4. GreenContractsAI introduces transparency by enabling users to track the carbon footprint of their blockchain transactions. This accountability motivates users to make eco-conscious choices and supports broader sustainability efforts.
5. Real-time Optimization: GreenContractsAI continuously monitors smart contract executions and provides real-time optimization suggestions. This dynamic approach ensures that eco-friendly practices are implemented promptly, reducing energy waste and carbon emissions.
6. Predictive Analysis: The AI employs machine learning to predict network congestion and transaction volumes, allowing it to make proactive adjustments to energy consumption. By avoiding peak energy usage periods, it helps lower the overall environmental impact of blockchain operations.
